# Keeps the Jodoh agent (npm start) online: restarts it if it crashes or the box
# reboots. The SDK already reconnects the WebSocket on network blips (ws.js
# ping/pong + backoff), so this only supervises the PROCESS.
#
# One WS connection per SDK key is allowed - a second agent process trips a
# "policy violation (duplicate key)" and one drops. So a named mutex enforces a
# single supervisor; don't also run "npm start"/"npm run health" by hand while
# this is up (prove-hire is HTTP-only and is safe to run alongside).
#
# ASCII only: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads .ps1 as the ANSI codepage, so a
# non-ASCII char (em dash, ellipsis) corrupts parsing. Keep it plain ASCII.

# Run now:        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\keepalive.ps1
# Survive reboot: a launcher in the user's Startup folder already runs this at
#   logon (see JodohAgent.cmd). Delete that file to stop auto-starting.

# Continue (not Stop): a transient hiccup must not kill the supervisor itself.
